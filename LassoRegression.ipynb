    "# Lasso Regression for Identifying Age At Onset of Alcohol Abuse #\n",

    "** Submitted as part of Machine Learning for Data Analysis by Wesleyan University **\n",
    "** Author: Oliver Morris **\n",
    "** Date: 24 March 2016 **\n",
    "\n",
    "The below analysis will show the code and describe the context of a lasso regression model constructed in python which identifies the age at which a person declares the onset of alcohol abuse GIVEN that there is some abuse. This regression model uses the NESARC data, which is a standard data set for the Wesleyan Univeristy course in Machine Learning & Data Analysis at Coursera. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the model does not attempt to classify whether there has been abuse or not. That was the subject of prior decision tree and random forest models.\n",
    "\n",
    "FYI. This blog entry was published using Jupyter, which is designed for sharing reproducible data science in python. The code was prepared in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition on Windows 10 with the Anaconda Python Environment and an IPython interactive window installed."

This is far more interpretable than the random forest model. another advantage fo a lasso model is that the variance of the model is low, i.e, it is not overtrained. This is evidenced by the mean square error on the trest set being only marginally higer than the training set. This is all good but the model is clearly very poor at explaining the data, the R.squared is only 12% for the test set.
